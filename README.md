## Social Tables Engineering Challenge

* Make sure to have an up to date version of node.js installed on your machine
* cd into project directory with your terminal
*  run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
* run ```npm run server```
* open a new terminal window
* run ```npm start```

Thank you for checking out my attempt at the coding challenge. It is not perfect, and I did not have
time to get to the optional features, but I'm pleased with the overall result.

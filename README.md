## Social Tables Engineering Challenge

* Make sure to have an up to date version of node.js installed on your machine
* cd into project directory with your terminal
*  run ```npm i``` to install dependencies
* run ```npm run server```
* open a new terminal window in same directory
* run ```npm start```

Thank you for checking out my attempt at the coding challenge. I wanted to make sure to get as much as I could done in a short period of time, because I unfortunately didn't see the job posting until the day after the deadline. It is not perfect, and I did not have time to get to the optional features, but I'm pleased with the overall result.

### Things that could be improved upon

In the stamp panel, I think the interraction with canvas is not all the way there. The images come out
a little wonky and aren't centered on the cursor. Additionally, in the pan panel, the dashed and dotted lines aren't quite all the way there. I did not master how to properly set the line dash.

When downloading a snapshot of the canvas, it does not seem to save as a .jpg file, or any specific 
file type at all.

### What aspect of your submission are you most proud of, and why?

I'm proud that I was able to write a couple of tests in Cypress. Testing has always seemed 
challenging to me, but the examples provided and a little reading showed that it's not all that bad.

### What would you work on if you had more time?

First thing would be to correct the styling of the radio inputs that select the type of line 
that the pen draws with. Styling inputs can be rather tricky for me.

I'd also want to work on the server side of the application.

### Of all the resources (blog posts, tutorials, videos, mentors etc.) you referenced, what was most helpful for you?

The starter code itself was very useful. I've also taken a recent course on Udemy that explained 
React Hooks, which I've included in the Helpful Resources section of this document.
